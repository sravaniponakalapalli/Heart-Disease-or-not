# Heart Disease Prediction
This project aims to predict the presence or absence of heart disease based on patient data using machine learning techniques.
## Overview
In this project, we utilize classification algorithms to develop models that predict whether a patient has heart disease or not. The dataset used for this task contains various attributes such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, and electrocardiogram readings.
## Requirements
To run the code in this project, the following libraries are required:
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
## Model
In this heart disease prediction project, logistic regression was employed as the primary model for classifying patients into those with or without heart disease based on their medical attributes. Logistic regression, a commonly used algorithm for binary classification tasks, calculates the probability of a patient having heart disease using a sigmoid function. The model achieved an accuracy of 0.8 on the test dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting heart disease. While logistic regression provided satisfactory results, future iterations of the project may involve exploring more advanced modeling techniques and refining feature selection to further enhance predictive performance.
## Results
The trained models achieve an average accuracy of 80% on the test dataset, indicating their effectiveness in predicting the presence or absence of heart disease
## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the potential of machine learning in predicting heart disease based on patient data. The developed models provide valuable insights into identifying individuals at risk of heart disease, enabling early intervention and improved healthcare outcomes.
